# README-Creator

The purpose of this project was to create a command line function that would use inquirer to pose prompts to the user about the details of their project. The README-Creator will then take this user inputted info and generate a README for the users project. This will include all sections associated with a project README as well as a badge for the users selected license.

## Usage

When the user enters node index.js into the command line, they will be prompted with a series of questions(title, description, installation, usage, contributing guidelines, test instructions, Github username, email, and a license). The prompts will then be neatly placed into a pre-existing README archetecture that will create a new README.md file for the user to easily place into their own project.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I struggled most at the onset of the project, the devdepedencies as a concept were new to me, my intial foray into this project lead to a few days of dealing with npm install errors and misplaced files. While frustrating, this allowed me time to really dive into them outside of class and gain a much better understanding of just how useful they can be to almost any project. The actual code for the generated README was simple enough with me relying on past projects and current understanding of how JS functions. I needed to do a bit of research to get the table of contents functioning but it left me with the knowledge of how to accomplish it not only for the rest of this class but the rest of my future career in the field.
